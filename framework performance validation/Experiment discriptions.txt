The signals used to generate the plots were aquired using a Picoscope 2204A
set to 2s/div time base, 1MS total samples, aquisition mode single, to give 
a 20 second recording at 50KHz.

# Response latency

A pyboard running 'input_follower.py' recieved a 51Hz square wave input generate by the Picoscope waveform generator.  The pyboard turned an output on and off to match the state of the input signal. The latency distribution was assessed by comparing rising and falling edge times for the input and output signals.

# Output timing accuracy

A pyboard running 'triggered_pulses.py' triggered a 10ms output pulse whenever an input rising edge occured. The triggering signal was an 51Hz sine wave generated using the Picoscopes waveform generator, to ensures that the trigger time drifted relative to the 1ms clock tick of the pyControl system.  The duration of the output pulses was measured to assess timing accuracy.

# Low and high load conditions.

The above measurements were conducted in both a low load and high load condition:

1.  Low load:  

	The only input recived by the pyboard was the 51Hz square wave.  Garbage collection was triggered once each cycle to ensure it did not occur at the same time as the input pulses.

2.  High load:

	As 1 but the reciving pyboard also recorded two digital inputs recieving poisson input pulse trains at 200Hz average event rate each (generated by annother pyboard running 'poisson_generator.py', and two analog inputs at 1KHz, with all data streamed back to the computer.
